Slide 1
Wrote bachelor thesis the last 4 to 5 month
Sadly, worked always on Monday so no team meetings for mee
But today I will present my bachelors thesis and what I have done
Bachelor’s Thesis Computer Science Probabilistic Short-term Wind Power Forecasting


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 2
So what am I going to talk about
Contents
- 01 Introduction -> little bit of Motivation 
- 02 Research Question -> main goal of the thesis, what is about
- 03 Approach -> theoretical approach and practical approach, so like the methods and the coding or model building
- 04 Results -> my results
- 05 Conclusion -> conclusion and discussion


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 3
- Introduction
Why bother with wind power forecasting at all?
-> to plan and operate a wind power farm you need to at least have a plan what wind power you can expect
-> Recent years big shift to renewable energy sources and 
-> cope with the shortage of traditional fossil energy and the environmental pollution
-> consequently successful integration of large amounts of wind power into the electricity supply system


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 4
-> In 2021 wind energy had the largest share in German electricity production, about 23 % and it is not going to get less. 
-We can see here in this graph, year and Terawatt-hour from wind power, tendency to get even bigger 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 5
-> research question, what have i done the last 4 months?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 6
-> How to make a wind power forecasting model?
What is a good approach? In my thesis I am looking at
- Multiple Linear Regression 
Support Vector Regression 
But I briefly talk about what else there is
Which model works better with the dataset? Can we use these models to make a windpower forecast? 
- I build 2 diff models and used some evaluation scores and evaluated and compared the different models

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 7
I used this breakdown to kind of categorise my work a little bit
Tian et al breakdown of approaches a review from last year
physical -> use physical variables
statistical -> use time-series data a wind farm generates
hybrid models -> combination of NWP and statistical methods

further divide statistical models into three categories: 
statistical artificial intelligence with a supervised machine learning approach
-> Multiple Linear Regression 
-> Support Vector Regression 

Some realted work, other papers and literature and reviews
Tawn et al (2022)
Tian et all (2021)
-> but generally a lot of papers and articles about the topic. therefore reviews work quite well for an overview for me


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 8
-> approach
As said beforea supervised machine learning approach
-> Multiple Linear Regression 
-> Support Vector Regression 
- First I talk a tiny little bit about the theory part and then what I did in practice

- What is Multiple Linear Regression
- What is Support Vector Regression
- What is an Evaluation Score or what do I use to evaluate my models and compare them

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 9
- Mult Lin Reg approach, first thing you learn in a machine learning related lecture or book or anything
statistical technique that uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome of a dependent variable
Kind of 2 methods to get a good models
- Linear least squares (LLS) or Ordinary Least Square is the least-squares approximation of linear functions to data to fit the regression line to the data
that results in the smallest squared error between the predictions of the model (yhat) and the actual outputs (y),  averaged over all examples in the dataset
- Maximum Likelihood estimation approach is a frequentist probabilistic framework 
that seeks a set of parameters for the model that maximize a likelihood function

example for Lin Reg, classical example (Boston housing prices)
We see the curve for our Lin Reg. As we can see the data points we minimize the range between the curve and all the datapoints
we have the number of rooms and predict the housing price -> 8 rooms like 40.000 dollar
- Here is just one independent variable (rooms) to predict the housing price, but we can choose more thanone


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 11
- SVM Support Vector Machines are used for Classification
- SVR is kind of the regression approach for working with continuous Values instead of Classification
In SVR, we try to fit the error within a certain threshold.

- Same dataset, Boston housing prices. 
we have the number of rooms and predict the housing price -> 8 rooms like 35.000 dollar -> not really good fit of the line
- Here is just one independent variable (rooms) to predict the housing price, but we can choose more thanone
- w the hyperplane shows the regression line as before
- The hyperplane is the line used to predict the continuous output for the regression. 
- we can see the ϵ-tube or margin with the borders w+ϵ and w-ϵ. We consider all the data points as long as our data
is inside this ϵ-tube. 
- We can also assign some slack variables ξ to account for any points outside the ϵ-tubeWe define a penalty for points outside the tube
- And then we try to find the tube where most of the data is within with as little as possible slack variables
- here with the same independent and dependent variables as before, but we can also choose more than one 
- Bu thats not all
- Until this point, our Support Vector Regression model only uses linear data.
- The cooler part is that we can make the model or more precise the data nonlinear by using the kernel trick


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 12
We can map our data into some higher feature space using a kernel (which has to follow some math equation like mercers theorem to work)
and then apply the Standard Support Vector Regression algorithm.
- we can map the seen data in to x^2 into a new featurespace of x^2.
Therefore we can map the data into a higher dimension using a kernel and then have many more opportunities to find
a better fit. Linear regression only looks at the linear possibilities.
- We do not have to calculate and map every single data point. We only have to calculate the dot product.
- for more magin and the math why this works-> Smola et all in "How Support Vector Regression works" does a very good job explaining all of this

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 13
- So to summarize
- We can choose how tolerant we are of errors, through the epsilon tube and by tuning our 
tolerance of falling outside that acceptable error rate with our Xi variables
- we can map linear data into a higher feature space to get a better regression line for the SVR
- There are many different kernels like RBF Kernel Linear Kernel Poly Kernel and many more...


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 14
So okai now we can build these 2 models. But how do we evaluate and assess them?
We can use some evaluation scores, which are all very basic mostly
- MAE -> mean absolute error, measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts, without considering their direction
- RMSE -> root mean squared error, RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. 
In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit.
R2 score -> how well the data fit the regression model (the goodness of fit). Gets calculated with 1 minus  the residual sumof square divided by Total Sum of Squares
CRPS -> comparison of the distribution of the predicted dataset with the real data from the test dataset.
Shapley Values -> attempt to explain why an ML model reports the outputs that it does on an input. 
Calculate by computing a weighted average payoff gain that a player provides when included in all coalitions that exclude the player.
In the simplest ML setting, the players of this cooperative game are replaced by the features of the ML model and the payoff by the model output itself

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 15
- After this therotical talking we can finaly come to the practical approach and what I did
- Cleaning the dataset
- Feature selection
- Multiple Linear Regression model Support Vector Regression model parameter and kernel selection


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 16
- The data is from the La haute borne windfarm in France -> fräännce
- about 150 km to the west of Strasbourg
- 4 turbines 
- Data from 2016 until 2018
- 138 columns -> like 30-35 different possible features and 217,588 rows od data with a time stamp
- before we can use the dataset I had to clean the datasets and correct any meassurement errors or throw away any Nans


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 17
- feature selection
- I tried some Algorithm from sklearn
- recursive feature elimination algorithm 
- select k-Best algorithm
- tried some features by hand
- evaluate the different features using Multiple Linear Regression model and taking the data into a 20:80 split so 
80 % to train the individual models and 20 % to evaluate them.
- Used MAE score, RMSE score, CRPS, and R2 scores


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 18
- Here we cans ee a selection of models or different combinations of features I have tried 
- on the left side are all the features we used in the model
- in the top is the individual model and a cross if we it uses the feature
- at the bottom we can see the individual evaluation scores
-as you can see model 7 had the best evaluations cores
Ba -> pitch angle in degree
Cosphi -> is the phase angle between voltage and current
DBt -> generator bearing temperature (lager)
Gbt -> gearbox temperature
Gost -> Gearbox oil sump (Ölwanne) temperatur
NF-> grid frequency fluctuates around 50 Hz in a +/- 20 mHz wide corridor
Ot -> outdoor temp
Rbt -> Rotor bearing temperatur (lager)
Rs -> rotor speed
Rt -> hub temp, component that connects the blades to the main shaft  
Va -> vane position, wind vane on the nacelle
Ws -> wind speed
Yt -> nacelle temperature 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 19
the pitch angle (BA) 
the hub temperature (Rt)
the nacelle temperature (Yt)
the wind speed (Ws)
the outdoor temperature (Ot)
- the pitch angle (BA) -> The pitch angle is the angle the blades of the wind turbine have.
- the hub temperature (Rt) -> Hub temperature describes the temperature of the hub. 
The hub is the component that holds the blades and connects them to the main shaft.
- the nacelle temperature (Yt) -> The nacelle temperature tells the temperature of the nacelle, which is the
housing on top of the main shaft.
- the wind speed (Ws)
- the outdoor temperature (Ot)
The wind speed and the outdoor temperature are self-explanatory

-> Not really surprising,wind speed and temperature, ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 20
- So we use these features for the Mult Lin Reg model and the SVR model with a 80:20 spilt for training and test data. Used the exactly same data, only change model parameters!
- For our SVR model as seen before we can determine the margin for the epsilon tube and the penalty parameter Xi and the kernel
- Here is a selection what we tried and what did look good for the SVR.
- Same evaluation scores here as well 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 21
- finally some results and something maybe more interesting
- first we look at the shapley values to get some informations about the model, then we look at some plots and at the evaluation scores

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 22
the pitch angle (BA) 
the hub temperature (Rt)
the nacelle temperature (Yt)
the wind speed (Ws)
the outdoor temperature (Ot)
The Shapley values for our Mult Lin reg model
We can try to explain what frature is more important for our different models
- The wind speed feature is approximately twice as important as every other feature
combined. The outdoor temperature is the least significant value

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 23
the pitch angle (BA) 
the hub temperature (Rt)
the nacelle temperature (Yt)
the wind speed (Ws)
the outdoor temperature (Ot)
- The Shapley values for our SVR
- We notice that not much has changed compared to the Mult Lin Reg model. The wind speed
feature is approximately twice as important as every other feature combined stil. 
- The outdoor temperature is more important for the SVR model than the Multiple Linear
Regression model. 
- The hub temperature is the least significant here. 
- Overall we can see that both models use the same features with kind of the same Shapley Value
distribution. Only the less essential features have changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 24
- as mentioned before used a train test splitof 80:20 so we have the test 
dataset and can plot the real data and the predicted data on a timeline.
Real dataset in orange
Blue lines are from the multiple Linear Regression data
Green is the SVR model
- on the left y axis we have Windpower in watt-hour and on the x axis a timeline 
The green and the orange functions are more close to each other.
- As we can see some spikes and lows are not quiet reached. A more narrow comparison in the next slides with evaluation values


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 25
- finally comparing the both models with pur best selected parameters and features our evaluation scores.
MAE	MultLin: 133.29  	SVR: 39.58   SVR 3 times closer
RMSE 	MultLin:  188.86 	SVR:60.87    Same as MAE as expected
R2 	MultLin:  0.829 	SVR:0.982    R2 really good for SVR
CRPS 	MultLin:  174.04 	SVR:122.19   CRPS comparing these values confirms the other evaluations cores

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 26
- to come to an conclusion

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 27
- what did the thesis consist of
- data processing	
- parameter selection
- modeling a Multiple Linear Regression model
- modeling a Support Vector Regression model
- evaluating and comparing the different models and come to an conclusion

-assessed two different machine learning approaches for wind power forecasting. 
Multiple Linear Regression model and a Support Vector Regression model. 
- Both models can predict wind power reasonably. However, the
SVR model has overall better evaluation scores. The MAE score, the RMSE score,
the R2 score, and CRPS show better results in the SVR model than in the Multiple
Linear Regression model. 
- So to finalize the SVR approach works better for this particular wind farm dataset. Furthermore, we suspect an SVR approach
generally works better for wind power prediction than a Multiple Linear Regression approach
- We assume that this is because the Mult Lin Reg only looks at the linear data where SVR can look at many differen feature space and may have other viewpoints to the dataset.

## Abstract
Wind power forecasting is required to plan and operate a wind power unit effectively and successfully. Therefore using different models to predict various wind power-related data is inevitable.  
This thesis discusses two kinds of wind power forecasting models - Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression. Multiple Linear Regression is a widely used and well-known concept and often serves as a benchmark for regression models. Support Vector Regression is a more complicated and elaborate concept but has shown promising results in related work.  
We look at these different approaches and build various models using data from the "La Haute Borne" wind farm in France. We define different evaluation scores to evaluate and compare the models. Both models make decent predictions. In conclusion, the SVR approach shows more promising results than the Multiple Linear Regression approach and can make a more accurate wind power forecast.

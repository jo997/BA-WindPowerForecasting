## Abstract
Wind power forecasting is required to plan and operate a wind power unit effectively and successfully worldwide. Therefore using models to predict different values are
inevitable.  
This thesis concerns two kinds of wind power forecasting models - Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR). 
Multiple Linear Regression is a widely used and well-known concept and often serves as a benchmark for regression models. 
Support Vector Regression is a more complicated and elaborate concept but has shown promising results in related work. 
We look at these different approaches and build various models using data from the "La Haute Borne" wind farm in France. 
In the end, we evaluate and compare the models. The SVR model shows better evaluation scores than the Multiple Linear Regression model and can make a more accurate wind power forecast.

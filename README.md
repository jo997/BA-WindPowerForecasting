## BachelorThesisWPF
In the upcoming decade, wind power will expand rapidly.   
In 2021 wind energy had the largest share in German electricity production, about 23 %.  
Wind power forecasting is required to plan and operate a wind power unit effectively and successfully.  
This thesis is about two kinds of wind power forecasting models - Multiple Linear Regression and Support Vector regression.  
Multiple linear regression is a widely used concept and often serves as a benchmark for regression models. Support Vector Regression is a more complicated concept but has shown promising results in related work.  
SVR is considered an overall suitable method for wind power forecasting. It is believed that the result is very precise, robust, and shows a compact description of the learned model.  
We will review and investigate these statements by building and evaluating these two different models and comparing them.
